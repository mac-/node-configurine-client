## Installation

	npm install configurine-client

## Usage

This module exposes a constructor function for creating new instances of the configuring client. The constructor takes an options object with the following properties:

* `host` - the protocol, hostname, and port of the configurine instance
* `clientId` - the client ID to authenticate with
* `sharedKey` - the client's shared key
* `loggingFunction` - (optional) a function that has the following method signature: `loggingFunction(String loglevel, String message, [Object context])`

Here's an example:

```javascript
var ConfigurineClient = require('configurine-client');
var client = new ConfigurineClient({
	host: 'http://localhost:8088',
	clientId: 'myclient',
	sharedKey: 'a1c1f962-bc57-4109-8d49-bee9f562b321'
});
```

Each client instance exposes the publc methods outlined below.


### getConfigByName

Retrieves a collection of config entries by name. This is the method signature:

```
getConfigByName(String name, [Object options], Function callback)
```

where:

* `name` - is the name to use to query configurine
* `options` - is an optional object that contains additional data to filter the query by, where the following properties are allowed:
	* `isActive` - defaults to true if not provided, and tells configurine to only query for entries that have the isActive flag set to `true`
	* `associations` - an object that contains application and/or environment associations to filter the query by
* `callback` - a method that expects to recieve an error object as the first parameter and a results object as the second that will be invoked when the response returns from configurine.

Here's an example:

```javascript
var options = {
	isActive: true,
	associations: {
		applications: [{
			name: 'myapp',
			versions: ['1.0.0']
		}],
		environments: ['production']
	}
};

client.getConfigByName('loglevel', options, function(err, results) {
	console.log(results); // an array of config resources
});
```

### getConfigById

Retrieves a single config entry by id. This is the method signature:

```
getConfigById(String id, Function callback)
```

where:

* `id` - is the unique id of the config entry to retrieve
* `callback` - a method that expects to recieve an error object as the first parameter and a results object as the second that will be invoked when the response returns from configurine.

```javascript
client.getConfigById('519c26189bc580ecf8000001', function(err, results) {
	console.log(results); // a single config resource
});
```

### createConfig

Creates a single config entry. This is the method signature:

```
createConfig(Object config, Function callback)
```

where:

* `config` - is the object representation of the resource to create
* `callback` - a method that expects to recieve an error object as the first parameter and a results object as the second that will be invoked when the response returns from configurine.

```javascript
var config = {
	name: 'loglevel',
	value: 'error',
	associations: {
		applications: [{
			name: "myApp",
			versions: ["1.0.0", "1.1.0"]
		}],
		environments: ["production"]
	},
	isActive: true,
	isSensitive: false
};
client.createConfig(config, function(err, results) {
	console.log(results); // the ID of the newly created resource
});
```

### updateConfigById

Updates a single config entry. This is the method signature:

```
updateConfigById(String id, Object config, Function callback)
```

where:

* `id` - is the unique id of the config entry to update
* `config` - is the object representation of the resource to update
* `callback` - a method that expects to recieve an error object as the first parameter and a results object as the second that will be invoked when the response returns from configurine.

```javascript
var config = {
	id: '519c26189bc580ecf8000001',
	name: 'loglevel',
	value: 'error',
	associations: {
		applications: [{
			name: "myApp",
			versions: ["1.0.0", "1.1.0"]
		}],
		environments: ["production"]
	},
	isActive: true,
	isSensitive: false
};
client.updateConfigById(config.id, config, function(err, results) {
	console.log(results); // true, if the resource was successfully updated
});
```

**Note**: The resource can only be updated if the owner of the resource matches the authenticated user. Also, updating the owner property will change the owner of the resource and therefore prohibit any further write actions by the previous owner.

### removeConfigById

Removes a single config entry. This is the method signature:

```
removeConfigById(String id, Function callback)
```

where:

* `id` - is the unique id of the config entry to remove
* `callback` - a method that expects to recieve an error object as the first parameter and a results object as the second that will be invoked when the response returns from configurine.

```javascript
client.removeConfigById('519c26189bc580ecf8000001', function(err, results) {
	console.log(results); // true, if the resource was successfully removed
});
```

**Note**: The resource can only be removed if the owner of the resource matches the authenticated user.
